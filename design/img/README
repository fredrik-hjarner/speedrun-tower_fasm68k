Not everything in these folders is used in this demo.
The build.json file should make it obvious what is.
I created a lot of tiles that I may use in a future demo or updated version of this demo.

These tiles are based off licensed tilesets.
This means you should pay the original creator if you want to use them.
This is where you can get the originals:
* Modern exteriors: https://limezu.itch.io/modernexteriors
* Modern interiors: https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors
* Modern office: https://limezu.itch.io/modernoffice
They are really cheap so go ahead and pay for them.
