3rd party graphics

Dialog & menu font is based off Deathwake font by Zee-3

 "Feel free to use any of these fonts for whatever purpose you see fit."

Scenery and sprite tilesets are based off the following licensed tilesets:
* Modern exteriors: https://limezu.itch.io/modernexteriors
* Modern interiors: https://limezu.itch.io/moderninteriors
* Modern office: https://limezu.itch.io/modernoffice
All three were created by LimeZu (https://limezu.itch.io/)

Physical Redistribution
******************************************************************************** 
I can't stop anyone from making physical reproductions of this demo but would
really prefer they didn't. This is a free game and I'd like to keep it that way.
Buying reproduction games only helps game counterfeiters, not the developers.
